### Optimization

This project has been passed throught Lighthouse audits, values are almost perfect, things missing are related to server configuration.

### Server side rendering

Server side rendering is been used to be more secure with api requests (api requets are made to get the necessary data).

### Images

Images were been optimized and each of them are been use with source set to improve performance in the site.

### PWA

PWA was not implemented because a server is required

### Sass
